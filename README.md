League of Recycle is a project aimed at promoting recycling practices in educational institutions. We developed an Android application using Java and Android Studio, which provides a fun and engaging platform for students to learn about the importance of recycling and how they can contribute to a sustainable future. Our app features interactive games, quizzes, and informative resources to make recycling education accessible and enjoyable for all ages.
